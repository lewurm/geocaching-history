Download My Finds Pocket Query Zip File From Geocaching.com
Go to the geocaching.com "Your Pocket Queries"
http://www.geocaching.com/pocket/default.aspx page, make sure the "Active
Pocket Queries" tab is selected, scroll down to the "My Finds" section, and
click on the "Add to Queue" button. A new My Finds pocket query will be
generated and geocaching.com will notify you via email when it is ready to
download. Note that you cannot use pocket queries that you create/customize
yourself on geocaching.com or other sites. Only this special "My Finds" pocket
query ZIP file will work. Other files will give you an error if you try to
upload them. See our FAQ for more detailed instructions.
